# OmniRealms Technical Specification - Part 9: Contract Systems

## 1. Core Contract Framework

```java
public class ContractSystem {
    private ContractRegistry registry;
    private ContractEngine engine;
    private BountyManager bounties;
    private EnforcementSystem enforcement;
    private DisputeResolution disputes;
    private AuditSystem audit;
}

public class Contract {
    private UUID contractId;
    private ContractType type;
    private ContractStatus status;
    private Set<Party> parties;
    private ContractTerms terms;
    private EnforcementPolicy enforcement;
    private Set<Consequence> consequences;
    private long timestamp;
    
    public enum ContractType {
        STANDARD,       // Basic agreements
        MISSION,        // Task-based contracts
        ALLIANCE,       // Player cooperation
        BOUNTY,         // Hunt/eliminate targets
        SERVICE,        // Ongoing services
        CHALLENGE,      // Competition/duel
        CASCADE         // Triggers other contracts
    }
}
```

## 2. Contract Creation System

        private Set<Condition> conditions;
        private Set<Reward> rewards;
        private Set<Penalty> penalties;
    }
}
```

    private AlertSystem alerts;
    
    public class ViolationDetector {
        private Set<ViolationType> activeViolations;
        private PenaltyCalculator penalties;
        private EnforcementTrigger trigger;
        private EscalationSystem escalation;
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Enforcement Actions
```java
public class EnforcementActions {
    private PenaltyExecutor penalties;
    private BountyGenerator bounties;
    private ReputationManager reputation;
    private AccountRestrictions restrictions;
    private NotificationSystem notifications;
    
    public class PenaltyExecutor {
        private Set<Penalty> activePenalties;
        private ExecutionQueue queue;
        private PenaltyTracker tracker;
        private AppealSystem appeals;
    }
}
```

## 4. Bounty System

### 4.1 Bounty Generation
```java
public class BountySystem {
    private BountyRegistry registry;
    private RewardCalculator rewards;
    private DifficultyScaler difficulty;
    private Matchmaker matchmaker;
    private TimeManager time;
    
    public class Bounty {
        private UUID bountyId;
        private Target target;
        private Set<Condition> conditions;
        private RewardStructure reward;
        private TimeLimit timeLimit;
        private DifficultyLevel difficulty;
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Bounty Types
```java
public enum BountyType {
    ELIMINATION,      // Target elimination
    CAPTURE,          // Capture target alive
    PROTECTION,       // Guard target
    SURVEILLANCE,     // Monitor target
    RETRIEVAL,        // Collect item/info
    SABOTAGE,        // Disrupt operations
    ESCORT           // Transport target
}
```

## 5. Mission System

### 5.1 Mission Generation
```java
public class MissionGenerator {
    private ScenarioBuilder scenarios;
    private ObjectiveGenerator objectives;
    private RewardBalancer rewards;

    public class Mission {
        private UUID missionId;
        private MissionType type;
        private Set<Objective> objectives;
        private RewardStructure rewards;
        private Set<Condition> conditions;

    private ConsequenceGenerator consequences;
    private EnforcementQueue queue;

        private Set<Evidence> evidence;
        private Set<Consequence> consequences;
        private AppealStatus appealStatus;
    }

}
```

## 7. Contract Interactions

    private ChainConditions conditions;
    private PropagationRules propagation;
    private FailureHandling failure;
    private RewardAggregator rewards;
    
    public class ChainConditions {
        private Set<Trigger> triggers;
        private Set<Dependency> dependencies;
        private FailurePolicy failurePolicy;
        private PropagationPolicy propagationPolicy;
    }
}
```

### 7.2 Contract Networks
```java
public class ContractNetwork {
    private Set<Contract> contracts;
    private RelationshipMap relationships;
    private ConflictResolver conflicts;
